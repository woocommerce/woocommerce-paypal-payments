PayPal's latest payment processing solution. Accept PayPal, Pay Later, credit/debit cards, alternative digital wallets and bank accounts.

== Description ==

One checkout solution. Many ways to pay. PayPal’s all-in-one solution allows you to offer PayPal, Venmo (US), Pay Later at no additional cost, credit and debit cards, and country-specific payment options.
= The all-in-one checkout solution* =
**WooCommerce PayPal Payments** lets you offer PayPal, Venmo (US only), Pay Later options, credit cards and more — all designed to help you maximize conversion.

= PayPal =
Help increase conversion by automatically offering PayPal buttons on product pages and at checkout. **Consumers are nearly three times more likely to purchase when you offer PayPal.¹**

= PayPal Pay Later =
Let customers pay over time while you get paid up front — at no additional cost. **PayPal Pay Later options are boosting merchant conversion rates and increasing cart sizes by 39%.²**

= Help increase conversions with Pay Later messaging =
PayPal Pay Later allows customers to pay over time while you get paid up front — at no additional cost to your business. And since 81% of younger consumers who use buy now, pay later decide which payment method to use before they get to checkout⁴, showing Pay Later messaging on your site lets customers know they have flexible options to pay over time while they are browsing — helping convert your browsers into buyers.

[Pay Later features are available in these countries.](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/pay-later/us/) Customers automatically see the most relevant Pay Later offering.

= Venmo (US only) =
Reach Venmo shoppers while allowing customers to share purchases with friends. **Venmo users spend 2.2 times more annually on online purchases compared to other online buyers.³**

= Country-specific payment methods =
Offer locally recognized payment methods to help build trust and reach international customers, including Payment Upon Invoice (PUI), a local payment option available only for purchases completed in Germany.

= Add credit and debit card processing capabilities =
**PayPal Payments** provides two different card processing options:

- **Standard Card Processing**: Card transactions are managed by PayPal in a prebuilt user experience, which simplifies your compliance requirements. Suitable for all business and personal seller accounts.

- **Advanced Card Processing**: Get everything that comes with PayPal’s standard integration, along with the ability to customize the look, feel, and placement of your debit and credit card payment fields. You can also use fraud protection tools to set up your own risk tolerance filters.

= Offer Subscription payments to help drive repeat business =

Create stable, predictable income by offering subscription plans.
WooCommerce PayPal Payments is compatible with [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).

[PayPal Subscriptions](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/subscription-payments) allow business and casual sellers to accept reliable recurring payments on a fixed billing schedule (buyers may require a PayPal account).

With the [Vaulting](https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/securely-store-payments) feature ([business account approval required](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-paypal-payments/#get-vaulting-approval)), you can offer flexible plans with fixed or quantity pricing, set billing cycles for the time period you want, and offer all kinds of subscriptions with prorated payments or discounted trial periods.

It’s easy for shoppers, simple for you, and great for your business – with no monthly or setup fees.
